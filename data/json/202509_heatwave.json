Note that the large decreases in forecasted MHW area when removing trends indicates that much of the apparent anomalous warmth comes from long-term warming rather than shorter term variability. Below is a regionally refined focus: Tropical Pacific - MHW likelihoods are low (0-10% [0-10%]; high confidence) in the eastern tropical Pacific through Boreal winter, consistent with La Ni\u00f1a-like conditions. North Pacific - Strong MHWs cover large swaths of the North Pacific, from the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan to the North American west coast. Through December, this pattern is likely to persist, with high MHW likelihoods in the central and western North Pacific (50-90% [30-70%]; low-medium confidence), but decreased chances of MHWs along the North American west coast (10-30% [0-20%]; medium-high confidence). North Atlantic - Elevated chances of MHWs are forecasted through December over much of the North Atlantic, with the highest probabilities in the Northeast Atlantic extending into the Arctic (60-90% [20-50%]; low-medium confidence). Southern Ocean - Chances of MHWs remain high through the rest of 2025 in scattered regions of the Southern ocean, in particular southeast of Africa (70-100% [50-80%] low confidence) and southeast of Australia (60-100% [30-60%]; low confidence). | Tropical Pacific - Forecasts predict that global MHW coverage will remain at ~25-30% [12-14%] over the coming year, with a slight decrease through the rest of 2025 and increase in the first half of 2026.
