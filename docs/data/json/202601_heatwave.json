MHW likelihoods have also increased west of California in the coming months (30-60% [10-30%]; medium confidence). | Tropical Pacific - MHW likelihoods through April 2026 are low in the central tropical Pacific (0-10% [0-10%]; high confidence), consistent with La Ni\u00f1a-like conditions. The models predict the development of El Ni\u00f1o conditions into boreal summer, increasing MHW chances in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific into mid-year (40-70% [20-50%]; medium confidence). Western tropical Pacific likelihoods are high due to warming trends, but low if those trends are removed (50-80% [10-30%]; medium confidence).",
