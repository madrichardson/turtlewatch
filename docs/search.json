    "text": "Proposed New Bycatch Avoidance Tool\nThe Temperature Observations To Avoid Loggerhead (TOTAL) tool was designed as an additional metric to guide the timing of the Loggerhead Conservation Area. The TOTAL tool consists of an indicator and a threshold (Welch et al. 2018). The indicator is a time-series of monthly temperature anomalies in the Southern California Bight smoothed by the preceding six months. The threshold is reference point, over which increased loggerhead bycatch has been demonstrated to occur.\nEach month, new temperature anomaly data are processed to extend the length of the indicator by one month. When the indicator is above the threshold, our analysis shows loggerheads are more likely to be present within the Loggerhead Conservation Area. When the indicator is below the threshold, loggerheads are less likely to be present, and fishing can occur with reduced bycatch risk."

    "text": "Photo copyright: NOAA Fisheries\n\n\n\n\n\nLoggerhead turtles reach maturity at about 35 years, but can live 50 years or more. Females lay about four clutches of eggs during the nesting season, each with 100-120 eggs. When the hatchlings emerge from the nests, they quickly move across the beach to the surf and swim offshore. Post-hatchling and juvenile loggerheads can travel great distances to reach food-rich coastal areas, where they remain until they mature. Adults return to nest at the beach where they hatched, known as the natal beach. The North Pacific population of loggerhead turtles in Southern California waters are juveniles that crossed the entire Pacific Ocean from natal beaches in Japan. They migrate back to natal beaches to nest and then remain in the Western Pacific Ocean as adults."

The fishery is also managed by California and Oregon via regulations to conserve target and non-target species. A drift gillnet is an unanchored panel of stretched mesh (14 inches or greater) suspended vertically in the water by floats along the top and weights along the bottom. Regulations require large mesh drift gillnet fishing off the West Coast to be equipped with acoustic pingers and extenders (&gt; 36 ft. buoy lines to protect marine mammals)."
